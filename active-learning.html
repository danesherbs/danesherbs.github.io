          A quick and dirty introduction to active learning

        When studying machine learning, we're often given a dataset like MNIST to practice on. Though in real-world problems we're often not given a dataset -- we have to create one ourselves. But creating datasets is time-consuming, especially when data needs to be manually labelled. Not all labels are equally useful, though. Ideally we collect the most informative data at minimal cost. That is, we prefer quality over quantity.
        </br>
        </br>
        That's the idea behind active learning.
        </br>
        </br>
        In active learning, the algorithm has control over which data point is labelled next. It requires far fewer data points to be labelled because we're not including the redundant ones.

        <b>Uncertainty sampling.</b> Pick the most uncertain data point \(x^* = \min_{x} \max_y p(y | x) \).
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Query by commitee.</b> Pick the most uncertain class \(x^* = \min_{x} p(\hat{y} | x)\) where \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted class.
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Information gain.</b> Pick the most uncertain class \(x^* = \min_{x} p(\hat{y} | x)\) where \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted class.
        </br>
        </br>
        <b>Rrror reduction strategy.</b> Pick the most uncertain class \(x^* = \min_{x} p(\hat{y} | x)\) where \(\hat{y}\) is the predicted class.
