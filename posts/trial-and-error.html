    Trial and Error

  A lot of good advice amounts to one principle: having a fast trial and error loop.

  When writing software, it's best to build the simplest end-to-end system as fast as possible. This
  leads you to ask the right questions earlier, like "do we really want to solve X, or do we actually want to
  solve Y?", "do we have the right expertise to solve problem Y?" and "how do we even measure our progress on
  problem Y?".

  <blockquote>
    “The question is, how fast can you discover that the thing you’re working on is the wrong thing to be working
    on.”
    <br>
    ― Astro Teller, Captain of Moonshots at X

  Maybe you've found it to be true in conversation. When you're explaining a concept, it's better to give a minute
  summary and elaborate if they're interested than to dive into detail at the outset.

  Or maybe you've found it to be true if you've written software. How much easier is it to write
  software with a REPL than without? What about when your program takes minutes to compile? It can be
  really frustrating when you're in a slow loop.

  Part of reaching a good solution is not getting discouraged after failing over and over. Paul Graham has often
  said the best predictor of start up success is how determined the founders are [1].

  Have a fast trial and error loop, and don't give up.
