        How likely is it that a solution to a problem is optimal? It's stupefyingly improbable [1]. We're therefore
        in the business of continually trying out new ideas and error correcting when solving a problem.

        <!-- Trial and error is surprisngly central to
        many good ideas (e.g. democracy), and a lot of good advice (from e.g. Y Combinator) boils down to one thing:
        tightening the feedback loop.

        advice boils down to one thing: tightening the feedback loop.

        When building software, it's best to build the simplest end-to-end system first, even if it's embarrassing to
        release. This leads to you
        asking the right questions earlier, like "do we really want to solve X, or do we actually want to solve Y?" and
        "how do we even measure our progress on problem Y?". The shorter the trial and error cycle, the better.

        </br>
        </br>

        You may even know this to be true from experience. How much easier is it to write software with a REPL than
        without?

        In science, candidate theories a chosen, experiments are performed and theories are error-corrected. In
        democracy, the best candidate is voted into power, their policy executed, and we error-correct by not voting in
        cadidates that repeat previous mistakes. In start ups,


        <ul>
          <li>Science - hypothesis, experiment, correct theory</li>
          <li>Democracy - David Deutsch - pick best candidate, error correct. Peaceful transition of power is key to the
            loop continuing to execute.</li>
          <li>Start ups - Paul Graham - talk to users (signal you should pay attention to), be determined (keep
            executing)</li>
          <li>Engineering - Google X - fail fast - “The question is,” said Dr. Teller, “how fast can you
            discover that the thing you’re working on is the wrong thing to be working on.”</li>
          <li>Growth Mindset - Carol Dweck - everyones first iterations of the loop look bad - experts are those that
            just kept executing the loop</li>
          <li>Elon Musk - Tesla - optimise for tighter feedback-loop between assembly line and engineers</li>
          <li>Job applications - applying and failing, then gaining relevant experience, as opposed to preparing for
            ages in isolation and realising that you should have been doing something completely different</li>
          <li>Programming - easier to program with a REPL</li>
          <li>Project management - build the simplest end-to-end system first. This leads to you asking the right
            questions earlier, like "do we really want to solve X, or do we actually want to solve Y?" and "how do we
            even measure our progress on problem Y?"</li>
          <li>Numerical analysis - absence of an analytic solution - try a solution, measure error, try a better
            solution next time. Iterative schemes for solving PDEs e.g. Gauss-Seidel, Lax Wendroff</li>
        </ul>

        <blockquote>
          “The question is,” said Dr. Teller, “how fast can you
          discover that the thing you’re working on is the wrong thing to be working on.”
        </blockquote>

        <ul>
          <li>Speed is time/step.</li>
          <li>Intelligence is work done/step i.e. how good error correction is.</li>
          <li>Determination is keep executing the loop. It's more important to keep executing the loop than to increase
            work done per step.</li>
          <li>Not getting discouraged while iterating the loop</li>
          <li>Whenever you can find a feedback loop you can be successful</li>
        </ul>

        PG's "talk to users" is telling you which signal to pay attention to. PG's "release early" is shortening the
        feedback loop. PG's "determination is more important than intelligence" is saying it's more important to execute
        the loop many times than to reduce the work done per step.

        </br>
        </br>

        A lot of good advice boils down to having a tighter trial and error loop (e.g. Google X "fail fast",
        PG's "release early"), or to keep executing it (e.g. Carol Dweck's Growth Mindset, PG's "determination matters
        more than intelligence").

        </br>
        </br>

        Have a tight trial and error loop, and don't give up.

        [1] Not true in constrained enviornments, such as in mathematics, that allows for analytic solutions. This is
        quite rare, though. For example, there's an analytic solution for the parameters in linear regression (the
        normal equations), but as soon as you deviate slightly and change the activation function to the logistic
        function, there's no longer an anlytic solution. Instead numerical methods are used, like gradient descent,
        which uses trial and error to find successively better parameters.
