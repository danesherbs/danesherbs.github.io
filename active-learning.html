        When studying machine learning, we're often given a dataset like MNIST to practice on. Though in real-world problems we're often not given a dataset -- we have to create one ourselves. But creating datasets is time-consuming, especially when data needs to be manually labelled. Not all labels are equally useful, though. Ideally we collect the most informative data at minimal cost. That is, we prefer quality over quantity.
        </br>
        </br>
        That's the idea behind active learning.
        </br>
        </br>
        In active learning, the algorithm has control over which data point is labelled next. It requires far fewer data points to be labelled because we're not including the redundant ones.
