        It turns out that many popular datasets used to evaluate Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are too small. Papers often report results on a single data split (usually the split in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08861">Yang et al., 2016</a>) and claim their model is superior with statistical significance. But their conclusions could have been entirely different on another data split!

        Myself and others in the ML/NLP team at Babylon Health actually found this to be the case while trying to pin down why a model we developed was performing so well. It turns out it was because we were using a library that evaluated models on data splits different to the conventional splits of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08861">Yang et al., 2016</a>. The bad news is that this mistake is extremely common. Even well-known peer-reviewed papers have made the same mistake [1].

        At about the same time, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05868">Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation</a> wrote about exactly this. We also found that DGI uses a different split to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08861">Yang et al., 2016</a>, and that papers have mistakenly compared models trained on these different splits.

        The popular datasets that have caused the most trouble are the citation networks Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed. Compared to modern datasets, they're relatively small:
